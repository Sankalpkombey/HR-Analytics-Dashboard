This project is an HR Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI to analyze workforce data and provide insights into employee attrition, demographics, income levels, and job roles. The dashboard leverages DAX measures, data modeling, and interactive visualizations to highlight key patterns and trends that can help HR professionals and business leaders make data-driven decisions to reduce attrition and improve employee satisfaction.
